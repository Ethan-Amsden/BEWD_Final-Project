# BEWD_Final-Project
Back End Web Development Final Project

## Short Description
I worked with a team of classmates to create a simple database driven website that generates a quote from the database either when the website is refreshed or when the end-user clicks the "New Quote" Button.

My main job was to build the database and add some quote records to it to make the Model side of the MVC pattern useable for testing and completion.
I also got to assist in other areas such as the back-end PHP and styling the front-end side of the website.
